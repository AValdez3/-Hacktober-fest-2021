 ## Hope it's as good as they say

# How it went
The task was super fun ! yet challenging in a good way, I wish I had more time to be more creative and to write some tests :) 

I might not write the best code, however I'm always very curious about learning new ways and principles. And I feel like CoffeeIT is a good place with good people to do just that, What do you think ? sorry... What do the beans think ?!
